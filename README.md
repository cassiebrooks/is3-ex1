To test with D3 locally use either:


* Python's built-in server:

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888 &`

* Python 3+

`python -m http.server 8888 &`

* If you have have PHP installed you could try

`php -S localhost:8888`

* Ruby

`ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8888`


Once this is running, go to http://localhost:8888/.

Or if you are running nodejs you can do

`npm install http-server -g`

`http-server`
